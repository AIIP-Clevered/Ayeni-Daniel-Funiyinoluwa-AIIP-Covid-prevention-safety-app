# Don’t touch your face project

## App’s Main Menu: 
Once the app starts, it shows a loading screen. Once it finishes loading, you should see your eyes and your wrists moving. 
## App’s Introduction:
The Don’t touch your face app is basically an app that warns you when you touch your face.

## While You don’t touch Your face
This is pretty straight forward. As long as you don’t touch your face, the box would display the green checkmark and everything would be fine.

## While You do touch Your face
Now, if you do touch your face, it would start to make a buzzing sound, indicating that you should stop touching your face. The computer also says out loud, “Stop touching your face”.
Sometimes the project may lag, and you may touch your face without the app recognizing it.
